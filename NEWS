		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.11

NEW FEATURES

- The default value of the `port` argument of `server_config()` can be set via
  the environment variable `R_SERVR_PORT`. If the environment variable does not
  exist, the global option `servr.port` will be used if set, e.g.,
  `options(servr.port = 4322)`. See `?servr::server_config` for details.

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.10

NEW FEATURES

- Added a function `browse_last()` to reopen the last browsed page.

MAJOR CHANGES

- The `daemon` argument in `server_config()` now defaults to `interactive()`, i.e., **servr** starts a daemonized server that does not block your interactive R session by default.

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.9

BUG FIXES

- The web browser may be opened too early (before the server is ready) (originally reported at rstudio/rstudio#2475).

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.8

NEW FEATURES

- added another implementation of the daemoinzed server based on the later package, since the previous implmentation based on `httpuv::startDaemonizedServer()` could crash the R session on Windows

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.7

NEW FEATURES

- added a new argument `watch` to `servr::httw()`

- exported the function `server_config()`

BUG FIXES

- files/directories that contain multibyte characters in path names cannot be served correctly (thanks, Hao Peng)

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.6

NEW FEATURES

- on 404 (page not found), 404.html will be displayed if it exists under the
  root directory

- improved the support for HTTP Range requests, e.g. servr can correctly serve
  MP4 videos now in major browsers including Safari

BUG FIXES

- servr should decode requested paths before reading them (https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/85)

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.5

NEW FEATURES

- added an argument `initpath` to `server_config()` so you can open a specific
  path initially in the web browser

- the `daemon` argument of `server_config()` takes the default value from the
  global option `getOption('servr.daemon')` now, e.g., you can set
  `options(servr.daemon = TRUE)` so that the daemonized server is always used

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.4.1

NEW FEATURES

- excluded ports considered unsafe by Chrome http://superuser.com/a/188070 when
  selecting a random port automatically

BUG FIXES

- fixed a bug in 301 redirection when serving a directory without the trailing
  slash

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.4

NEW FEATURES

- you can disable websocket listening on an HTML page using a special HTML
  comment `<!-- DISABLE-SERVR-WEBSOCKET -->` when servr is serving and watching
  a directory, so that this page will not communicate with R (e.g. when it is
  updated, R will not send signals to refresh it) (thanks @hafen, #25)

- a random TCP port will be used if the port 4321 is not available

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.3

NEW FEATURES

- added a function `httw()` to watch for changes under a directory and refresh
  an HTML page automatically (if it is being viewed in the browser) when any
  files are modified

- servr accepts HTTP Range requests now (thanks, @rekado, #21)

BUG FIXES

- servr did not work with RStudio Server (#20)

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.2

NEW FEATURES

- when running inside RStudio, the RStudio web browser will be used if
  available (requires RStudio >= 0.98.439)

- added three server functions jekyll(), rmdv1(), and rmdv2() to serve Jekyll
  websites, R Markdown v1, and R Markdown v2 documents, respectively

- added a server function vign() to serve R Markdown/HTML package vignettes

- added a server function make() to serve a directory and update files
  automatically via Makefile (#2)

- the URL pathname foo will be redirected to foo/ automatically if foo is a
  directory (#5)

- in case of errors when serving dynamic documents, the server functions will
  double the delay to check for updates and wait for the next build until the
  error is cleared (like Gmail)

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.1

NEW FEATURES

- the main function httd() to start an HTTP server for a local directory
