  selecting a random port automatically

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.4

NEW FEATURES

- you can disable websocket listening on an HTML page using a special HTML
  comment `<!-- DISABLE-SERVR-WEBSOCKET -->` when servr is serving and watching
  a directory, so that this page will not communicate with R (e.g. when it is
  updated, R will not send signals to refresh it) (thanks @hafen, #25)

- a random TCP port will be used if the port 4321 is not available

		 CHANGES IN servr VERSION 0.3

  websites, R Markdown v1, and R Markdown v2 documents, respectively

- added a server function make() to serve a directory and update files
  automatically via Makefile (#2)

- the URL pathname foo will be redirected to foo/ automatically if foo is a

- in case of errors when serving dynamic documents, the server functions will
  double the delay to check for updates and wait for the next build until the
  error is cleared (like Gmail)
