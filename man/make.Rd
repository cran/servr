\description{
You can define how and when to rebuild files (such as R Markdown files) using
Make rules, e.g. a rule \command{_posts/\%.md: _source/\%.Rmd} with a command
to build \file{.Rmd} to \file{.md} will be executed if and only if
\file{foo.Rmd} is newer than \file{foo.md}. The exit status of the command
\command{make -q} will decide whether to rebuild files: rebuilding occurs
only when the exit code is not \code{0}. When an HTML file has been rebuilt,
it will be automatically refreshed in the web browser.
}
\note{
You must have installed GNU Make to use this function. This is normally
  not a problem for Linux and OS X users (it should be available by default).
  For Windows users, you can either install GNU Make, or just install
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/}{Rtools}, which also
  contains GNU Make.

# some built-in examples (if you are not familiar with make, you can take a look
# at the Makefile of each example)

servr::serve_example("make2", servr::make)
